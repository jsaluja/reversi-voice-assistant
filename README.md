**A real-time AI-powered voice assistant for the classic strategy game Reversi/Othello**

*Built for "The Voice of AGI" Hackathon*

## 🏆 Hackathon Alignment

This project directly addresses the **Voice AI** category of the hackathon, combining:
- **Real-time voice synthesis** using Azure Text-to-Speech and ElevenLabs
- **Strategic AI analysis** powered by Azure OpenAI GPT models
- **Conversational game coaching** with natural voice feedback

Fit for the **Vapi Prize** ($1000 + credits) for "Best Voice AI Project" and demonstrates innovative real-time AI applications.

## 🎮 What It Does

The Reversi Voice Assistant is a Chrome extension that transforms your Reversi/Othello gameplay experience by providing:

- **🗣️ Real-time voice coaching**: AI analyzes the current board state and speaks strategic recommendations

- **📊 Live game tracking**: Automatically detects game state changes and provides instant feedback
- **🎨 Visual overlays**: Highlights recommended moves directly on the game board
- **⚙️ Multiple TTS support**: Choose between Azure Text-to-Speech or ElevenLabs or Vapi (coming soon) for voice output

## 🎯 Demo

The assistant works on [cardgames.io Reversi games](https://cardgames.io/reversi/) and provides:

1. **Strategic Analysis**: "Row 3, Column 8. Secures right edge control, flipping 4 pieces"
2. **Tactical Warnings**: Avoids dangerous moves that give opponents corner access
3. **Endgame Guidance**: Optimizes final moves to maximize chances of winning the game
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Instant voice recommendations as the game progresses
